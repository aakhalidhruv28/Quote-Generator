## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aakhalidhruv28/Quote-Generator.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Quote-Generator
    ```
3.  **Get your API Key:**
    Follow the instructions in the [Setting Up the OpenRouter API](#-setting-up-the-openrouter-api) section below to get your free API key.

4.  **Add your API Key:**
    Open the `script.js` file and replace the placeholder with your key:
    ```javascript
    const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
    ```
5.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your browser. For the best experience (and for the Copy/Share APIs to work correctly), it's recommended to use a live server.
    - If you use VS Code, you can install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and click "Go Live" from the bottom bar.

## üîë Setting Up the OpenRouter API

This project uses **OpenRouter.ai** to access powerful language models for free. Follow these steps to get your own API key:

1.  **Create an Account**: Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) and sign up for a free account. You get free credits upon signing up, which are more than enough for personal projects.

2.  **Go to Keys**: Once logged in, click on your profile icon in the top right and select **"Keys"**.

3.  **Create a New Key**: Click the **"+ Create Key"** button. Give it a name (e.g., "QuoteGeneratorProject") and click "Create".

4.  **Copy Your Key**: Your new API key will be displayed. It will look something like `sk-or-v1-abc...xyz`. Click the copy icon.

5.  **Add to Project**: Paste this key into the `script.js` file as described in the "Getting Started" section.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note**: Never commit your API keys to a public GitHub repository. For a real-world application, use environment variables to keep your keys safe. This project includes the key directly for simplicity of demonstration.

## üí° How to Use

Using QuoteSphere is intuitive and straightforward.

1.  **Generate a Basic Quote**: Simply click the **"Generate Quote"** button to get a random, inspiring quote.

    - Select `Funny` from the Category dropdown.
    - Select `Hindi` from the Language dropdown.
    - The AI will use the following prompt:
      ```
      Give me a creative, unique quote about 'happiness' in the category 'Funny' in Hindi language.
      ```

3.  **Use the Action Buttons**:
    - **Copy**: Click the copy icon to save the quote and author to your clipboard.
    - **Speak**: Click the volume icon to have the quote read to you.
    - **Save**: Click the star icon to add the quote to your favorites. The star will become solid to indicate it's saved. Click it again to remove it.
    - **Share**: Click the share icon to open your device's share menu or a Twitter link.

4.  **Manage Favorites**:
    - Scroll down to the "Favorite Quotes" section to see your saved items.
    - Click the trash can icon next to any quote to remove it from the list.
    - Click **"Export as TXT"** to download a text file of all your saved quotes.
